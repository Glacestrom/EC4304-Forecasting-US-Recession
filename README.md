# EC4304 - Forecasting the Next US Recession
## Disclaimer
While this project was a collaborative group effort, I want to emphasize that all the Python codes (including the XGBoost model) was entirely my own work and is self-contained. As the other aspects of the project were conducted using Stata, no additional code is necessary to reproduce the results of the XGBoost model. Should you have any queries or need further information, please don't hesitate to get in touch. Thank you for your understanding.
## Introduction
Following Kauppi and Saikonnen (2008)â€™s model with the US interest rate spread data, we developed dynamic binary probit/logit models for predicting U.S. recessions using the interest rate spread & lags of the recession binary variable as the driving predictors with gradient boosting.
